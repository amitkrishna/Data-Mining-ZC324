# Data-Mining-ZC324

## Part 1:

Implement the k-means clustering and DBSCAN algorithms from scratch.

## Part 2:

Run the algorithms on synthetic datasets with globular and non-globular shapes, and note
down your observations. You may use the make_classification, make_moons and
make_circles APIs from scikit-learn to generate the datasets. Study the impact of noise in the
datasets on the clustering algorithms.

## Part 3:

Run the algorithms on the Iris dataset (iris.csv) after removing the class labels. The dataset
description can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris . Note own your
observations with (i) different values of k for k-means (ii) different values of eps and minpts
for dbscan.

Compare the results of the clustering algorithms you implemented with the class labels
provided in the dataset.
## Part 4:

Run the algorithms on the Wholsale_customers_data.csv dataset. The dataset description is
given at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers
Note own your observations with (i) different values of k for k-means (ii) different values of
eps and minpts for dbscan.
